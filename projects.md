Here are some of the projects/research I've been involved in.

### Money Transferring Path Optimization: Multiple-layer Maximum Cycle Mean Problem with Activation Matrix  
This project is advised by [Professor Amir Ali Ahmadi](http://aaa.princeton.edu/).  
Our current research in graph theory is framed as a stochastic money-transfer route
optimization problem based on the maximum mean cycle problem [MCMP](http://web.mit.edu/~a_a_a/Public/Publications/AAA_PP_CDC2012.pdf). 

We expect that this research will span over two semesters of my senior year and we hope to use convex optimization to approximate theoretical solution to the problem and recurrent neural network to reduce computation time while adding more complexity and richness to the model along with Markov model for checking purpose.  


### Policy Testing for Jet Engine’s Supply Chain 

I have worked under Professor [Warren Powell](http://castlelab.princeton.edu/)'s supervision to implement a supply chain
management simulation program in Python. The narrative is that the graph represents jet engine manufacturer's
suppliers from leaf nodes to one root node with multiple tuning knobs.  
I then coded a program to evaluate online learning policies for tuning these knobs to counter engine part shortages in cooperation with [
Dionysios S. Kalogerias](https://dk9.mycpanel.princeton.edu/wordpress/) with the old open version can be found in this [github](https://github.com/dkalogerias/SupplyChain_Public). After policies evaluation, I made visual representations of the simulation that led to further cooperation with United Technologies. The final report is [here]({{site.url}}/pdfs/supply_chain-final-report.pdf)  

### Analysis of rank 1 perturbations in general β ensembles

I work with Professor [Adam W. Marcus](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amarcus/) under Princeton University mathematics department's
grant. The research topic is random matrices theory, specifically on analysis of rank 1 perturbations in general beta
ensembles. The research spanned over two months with a paper currently pending publishing once the over-arching
narrative is completed. The paper can be found [here](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amarcus/papers/beta.pdf)
