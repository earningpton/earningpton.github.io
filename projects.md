Here are some of the research projects I've been involved in.

### Lossless DNA Compression: Bi-directional LSTM state-of-the-art compression model 

This project is advised by [Christian Steinruecken](https://q4.github.io/).  
We explore state-of-the-art lossless DNA compression algorithms,
experiment with predictive probabilistic models for DNA sequences, and perform a
comprehensive analysis and comparison among different schemes. [DNA Compression Paper](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/files/2019-2020_dissertations/lossless_dna_compression.pdf). The research is featured on the front page of Cambridge MLMI class of 2020 thesis [Link](https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/course-highlights/2019-2020).

### Money Transferring Path Optimization: Multiple-layer Maximum Cycle Mean Problem with Activation Matrix  

#### Honors: Ahmet S. Çakmak Prize awarded for an exceptional thesis
This project is advised by [Professor Amir Ali Ahmadi](http://aaa.princeton.edu/).  
Our research in graph theory is framed as a stochastic money-transfer route
optimization problem based on the maximum mean cycle problem [MCMP](http://web.mit.edu/~a_a_a/Public/Publications/AAA_PP_CDC2012.pdf). We used convex optimization and online learning techniques to approximate theoretical solution to the problem while adding more complexity and richness to the model.  

### Stock Sentiment Analysis from Market Headlines with Natural Language Processing 

This project is done as part of a minor in Statistics and Machine Learning at Princeton University. 
We introduce a model for analyzing sentiment from financial news, where sentiment from response comments is processed to represent the ground truth of article headlines. The new ground truth sentiments are tested and evaluated against human judgment, and multiple machine learning models are utilized to assess preliminary prediction accuracy of the new sentiments. The presentation poster is linked [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZpGntCi64qHDTJY9un3qVdOmTrI3peva/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113070174757616690380&rtpof=true&sd=true).

### Policy Testing for Jet Engine’s Supply Chain 

I have worked under Professor [Warren Powell](http://castlelab.princeton.edu/)'s supervision to implement a supply chain
management simulation program in Python. The narrative is that the graph represents jet engine manufacturer's
suppliers from leaf nodes to one root node with multiple tuning knobs.  
I then coded a program to evaluate online learning policies for tuning these knobs to counter engine part shortages in cooperation with [
Dionysios S. Kalogerias](https://dk9.mycpanel.princeton.edu/wordpress/) with the old open version can be found in this [github](https://github.com/dkalogerias/SupplyChain_Public). After policies evaluation, I made visual representations of the simulation that led to further cooperation with United Technologies. The final report is [here]({{site.url}}/pdfs/supply_chain-final-report.pdf)  

### Analysis of rank 1 perturbations in general β ensembles

I work with Professor [Adam W. Marcus](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amarcus/) under Princeton University mathematics department's
grant. The research topic is random matrices theory, specifically on analysis of rank 1 perturbations in general beta
ensembles. The research spanned over two months with a paper currently pending publishing once the over-arching
narrative is completed. The paper can be found [here](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~amarcus/papers/beta.pdf)
