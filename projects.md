Here are some of the projects/research I've been involved in.

### Analysis of peeling algorithms for random graph vertex order recovery

This project is advised by [Professor Miklos Racz](http://mracz.princeton.edu/).  We
want to give a more precise characterization of the algorithm proposed [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/043a/4b15b8f563002e1d1e3ee8dea5eed9aa26ca.pdf) for vertex order recovery in random graphs.  A report containing
the progress we made in spring '18 is [here]({{site.url}}/pdfs/report.pdf), and a blog post giving a high level description is [here]({{site.url}}/peeling).  The project is still ongoing, and we are excited about making more inroads!


### WallStreetBets

During HackPrinceton Fall '17, a few of my friends were working on implementing a trading idea that revolved around posts on a SubReddit called /r/WallStreetBets.  In the middle of their project, they asked me to whip up/implement a suitable ML algorithm for their strategy.  The results are in this [repository](https://github.com/houcharlie/WallStreetBets).  Surprisingly enough, it didn't do too badly in the time that we tested the strategy (the morning of presentations).
### Police App

In summer '15, I made an Android application, intended for use with the Nashville Police Department to replace an outdated radio system for patrol car communication. This was my first programming project, and I learned quite a lot! The code can be found on GitHub [here][2]. It is not being maintained, and is written at the level of someone just learned how to program.
