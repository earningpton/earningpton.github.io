This post will contain the ideas behind the evolutional algorithm and its actual application.  If you read this post and want t try out the algorithm, this [link](https://github.com/earningpton/Evolutional_Algorithm) contains the python for implementation as well as an example data set for you to try out.

## Differential Evolution

### Key Concept
Differential Evolution or DE is a simple stochastic and population based minimizer. Because it is a metaheuristic method, there are several expectations to make known first

1. It does not guarantee an optimal solution, unless the termination constraint includes max number of iterations performed
2. It is only as good as the given search area allows
3. The problem does not need to be differentiable or continuous, a massive advantage in the constraints-search type problem

May take very long run time due to how our problem is set up.

### KPI Constraints-search Problem
This problem is proposed as an open-ended adjustment question on the distribution of Key Performance Indicator scores. The KPI score ranges from 1 to 5 for each customer and depends on #failures and #successes in various provided services. Because each service is different, its acceptable rate of failure and its importance weight differs (note that importance weight only matters when combine all KPIs.

To this end, each service has six adjustable parameters that affects its own KPI and its weight, two of which parameters are normally fixed. 

The parameters used for KPI adjustment are:
- High failure Threshold (HT)
- Low failure Threshold (LT)
- Highest Weight (HW)
- Lowest weight (LW)

The fixed ones for this problem are:
- Volume Threshold for Weight Adjustment (VTW)
- Failure Threshold for Weight Adjustment (FTW)

The client wants a certain distribution shape of customers' KPI, our job is to adjust HT,LT,HW,LW such that the KPI distribution fits the shape as much as possible. Previously, the algorithm used is educated guess along with professional hand adjustments. This workbook aims to propose a more algorithmic approach to the solution-finding method, namely Differential Evolution.

### Differential Evolution Algoritm
Below is a flow chart of how Differential Evolution works.
