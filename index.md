Welcome to my website!  

My name is Woramanot Yomjinda but please call me by my nickname Earning. I am currently a senior at the Operations Research and Financial Engineering department of Princeton University.  

At Princeton, I am working on research projects advised by [Amir Ali Ahmadi](http://aaa.princeton.edu/) and, for independent work, [Warren Powell](http://castlelab.princeton.edu/).  

My main interests include natural language processing, neural architect search, machine learning  implementation in service industry, optimization, and reinforcement learning.  

Some articles that I have written (including technical articles on research and data science) and the articles I will be writing will be placed in my personal [blog](https://earningpton.github.io/blog/).  

I love to study films and also made a [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4985650/?ref_=nm_knf_t1), but I also like cooking Thai food.  

Thank you to [Charlie Hou](https://houcharlie.github.io/) for allowing me to use his template!  

My [resume]({{site.url}}/pdfs/Resume_.pdf) is also included for more information.  

If you want to contact me or get in touch, I would be elated! Please contact me at:
