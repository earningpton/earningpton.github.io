Welcome to my website!  

My name is Woramanot Yomjinda but please call me by my nickname Earning. I am currently a quantitative researcher at Millennium Management.  

At the University of Cambridge, I graduated MPhil with Commendation in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence in 2020. At Princeton, I graduated Bachelor with Summa Cum Laude in Operations Research and Financial Engineering in 2019. My research project on Money Laundering advised by [Amir Ali Ahmadi](http://aaa.princeton.edu/) won an Ahmet S. Ã‡akmak Prize awarded for an exceptional thesis.  

For some side projects I did, check out my puzzle game submission to GMTK Game Jam 2022 competition [Dungeon vs DiceGuy](https://remytherat.itch.io/dungeons-vs-dicey), my makeshift personal AI [PLEASEBOT](https://mega.nz/#!kUUyAI7Z!yvBH1F6TeJTBKKOvl3lsXEAqRgFAFwFWsoMAv64zrQQ) (only works for Windows) [Github link](https://github.com/earningpton/pleasebot) and also a web-based medieval fantasy game [Death-to-the-Goblins](https://earningpton.github.io/Goblins-Game/) 

My main interests include bu not limited to natural language processing, sequential prediction, online learning, neural architect search, machine learning  implementation in service industry, optimization, and reinforcement learning.  

Some articles that I have written (including technical articles on research and data science) and the articles I will be writing will be placed in my personal [blog](https://earningpton.github.io/blog/).  

I love to study films and also made a [movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4985650/?ref_=nm_knf_t1). I also enjoy cooking Thai food from Pad Thai to Tiger Cry Steak.  

Thank you to Gene Li for allowing me to use his template!  

My [resume]({{site.url}}/pdfs/WY_CV_Quant_latest.pdf) is also included for more information.  

If you want to contact me or get in touch, I would be elated! Please contact me at:
