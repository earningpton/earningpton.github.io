Hi!  I'm currently a senior at the Operations Research and Financial Engineering department of Princeton University.
At Princeton, I am working on separate research projects advised by [Yuxin Chen](http://www.princeton.edu/~yc5/) and [Miklos Racz](http://mracz.princeton.edu/).  My research interests include optimization, control/reinforcement learning,
random graphs, and statistical inference.

I also like writing fiction and [cooking](https://youtu.be/ATmsipFdZQ4).

Thank you to [Gene Li](https://gxli97.github.io/) for letting me use his template!
